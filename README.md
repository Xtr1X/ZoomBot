# ZoomBot
A simple zoom bot that joins your zoom classes on time, mutes you, and types whatever text you'd like.


Requires Python 3.x.x Or Higher


You will need to have zoom downloaded and logged into your account for this to work properly. 
You will also need to follow the instructions below.

- Setup Instructions: -
* You will only have to do this once. *

#1. Open Zoom Settings

#2. Open General

#3. Make Sure "Ask me to confirm when I leave a meeting" is UNCHECKED

#4. Open Keyboard Shortcuts

#5. Bind "Mute/Unmute My Audio" To Your Num Lock Key

#6. Bind "Show/Hide In-meeting Chat Panel" To Your Insert Key



#7. Open Any Zoom Meeting Link In Your Default Web Browser. 

It will give you a popup saying the site wants to open the zoom app.

Check the "Always allow zoom.us to open links" check box and press open.



#8. Put your zoom link in the zoomlink.txt



#9. Set your chats in the chat files. 

This is what the bot will type into the zoom chat once you join the meeting. 

Leave these files empty to type nothing.
